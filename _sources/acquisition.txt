Data Acquisition
================

Theory
------

Preparing the data involves the following one or two steps:

* :doc:`vector-graph`
    Turning a Function Graph into a Vector Graph.

* :doc:`analyzer`
    Extracting feature points from a Vector Graph for matchline overlay comparison.

Applications
------------

It can be applied to a lot of different applications:

* :doc:`stroke-analyzer`
   Partially working.

   Generic frontend for pen-strokes.

   Example: Recognising Asian characters. (See http://www.symboloh.com)
* Analyzing a time-based series of Function Graph data.
   Not yet implemented :)
   
   Turns a Function Graph into a Vector Graph. Extracts feature points.

   Example: Frontend for non-realtime signal analysis.

   Example: Frontend for stock market quotes.

In different fields:

* Pen-Stroke UI
* Signal Analysis
* Data Visualisation
