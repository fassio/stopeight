Data Acquisition
================

Preparing the data involves the following one or two steps:

1. Turning a Function Graph into a Vector Graph.
2. Extracting feature points from a Vector Graph for matchline overlay comparison.

It can be applied to a lot of different applications:

* :doc:`stroke-analyzer`
   Partially working.

   Generic frontend for pen-strokes.

   Example: Recognising Asian characters. (See http://www.symboloh.com)
* Analyzing a time-based series of Function Graph data.
   Not yet implemented :)
   
   Turns a Function Graph into a Vector Graph. Extracts feature points.

   Example: Frontend for non-realtime signal analysis.

   Example: Frontend for stock market quotes.

In different fields:

* Pen-Stroke UI
* Signal Analysis
* Data Visualisation

Turning a Function Graph into a Vector Graph
--------------------------------------------

Function Graph
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Any time-based data set with an accurate sampling rate can be used to build a function f(x).

Vector Graph
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This function graph can be converted into a sequence of vectors in a two-dimensional plane.

The construction of the graph can be seen here:

Definition of the ratio between opposite and adjacent of the right triangle:

Delta f(x) at point A / the average of all Delta f(x) of the Delta x's between x0 and x1.

Condition: All Delta x are invariant.

By varying the step-size you can achieve:

And by making it even smaller you can get:

This last step reduces the impulse scaling to half the frequency found in the previous example. So for matchline overlay comparison the previous vector graph is preferred.

Extraction of Feature Points
----------------------------

The analyzer then converts the vector graph into a sequence of one Turn, one Corner and one Turn. The sequence - starting with a Turn - has one Corner terminated by a turn and is concatenated into Turn-Corner-Turn-Corner-Turn.

This input can be used to make a matchline overlay comparison (See :doc:`scripts`) to previously recorded vector graphs.
