Extraction of Feature Points
----------------------------

The analyzer then converts the vector graph into a sequence of one Turn, one Corner and one Turn. The sequence - starting with a Turn - has one Corner terminated by a turn and is concatenated into Turn-Corner-Turn-Corner-Turn.

This input can be used to make a matchline overlay comparison (See :doc:`comparator`) to previously recorded vector graphs.
