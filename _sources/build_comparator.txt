As of 08/2016 python version 3.5, 2.7 and Ubuntu 14.04 have been tested.

   :members:

:mod:`stopeight.multiprocessing` is using the Python multiprocessing module. You can test if your Python installation and the underlying OS support this by running from within a Python shell::

    >>> from multiprocessing import synchronize

Clone into the repository::

    $ git clone https://github.com/specpose/stopeight.git

Due to the development status and likeliness to change API interfaces these modules are not yet available in the Python package repository:

:mod:`stopeight.comparator`

:mod:`stopeight.logging`

:mod:`stopeight.multiprocessing`

If you want to install to your system::

    $ sudo apt-get install python-setuptools
    $ cd /path/to/where/stopeight
    $ python setup.py build
    $ sudo python setup.py install

Non-API modules are not installed and tested with python >2.7, they are available in the repository only:

:mod:`stopeight.server`

:mod:`stopeight.tests`
