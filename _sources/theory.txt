Preparing the data involves the following one or two steps:

* :doc:`vector-graph`
    Working.

    Turning a Function Graph into a Vector Graph.

* :doc:`analyzer`
    legacy pen-stroke version: Partially working.

    analyzer time-series and resolution independent version: Not yet implemented.

    Extracting feature points from a Vector Graph for matchline overlay comparison.

The comparator can do searches in the prepared data:

* Comparator
    Working.
