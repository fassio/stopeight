Every zero crossing $t_{m}$ of the 2nd derivative
\begin{equation}
\{t_{m}\}_{m \in \mathbb{Z} , f''(t_{m})=0}
\end{equation}
For all the Intervals $t_{m}-t_{m-1}=T$ of a signal $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$
\begin{equation}
\eta(T)=\{t \in \mathbb{R}; t_{m} - t_{m-1}=T \vert f''(t_{m})=0, f''(t_{m-1})=0, t \le t_{m}, t \ge t_{m-1} \}
\end{equation}
Note: $\eta$ is a Lebesgue.\\\\
For all the positive and negative function values $f(t)$ respectively
\begin{align}
\eta_{+}(T)=\{{\eta \vert f(t) \ge 0}\}\\
\eta_{-}(T)=\{{\eta \vert f(t) \le 0}\}
\end{align}
Parseval's theorem
\begin{equation}
\int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty} \vert f(t) \vert ^2 \mathrm{d} t = 1/2\pi * \int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty} \vert \hat{f}(1/T) \vert ^2  \mathrm{d} T
\end{equation}
Can be interpreted for signed function values as
\begin{equation}
\int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty} (\underbrace{\int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty} \delta (U - T) \mathrm{d} U}_{1} * (\int\int f(t) \mathrm{d} t \underbrace{\mathrm{d} \eta}_{\text{depends on T}}) )\mathrm{d} T = 1/2\pi * \int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty} \hat{f}(1/T) \mathrm{d} T
\end{equation}
Note: Major $U$ is a unique period, not a point in time. $U$ is not continuous, $\delta$ is the discrete Dirac Delta.\\\\
The convolution of the signal with a periodicity T is equal the distributed energy of two semi-pulse functions of the same periodicity. The negative part $\eta_{-}$ is interpreted as a purely imaginary complex number $z_{2}$.
\begin{equation}
\int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty}(\int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty} \delta (U - T) \mathrm{d} U * (\underbrace{\int \int f(t) \mathrm{d} t \mathrm{d} \eta_{+}}_{z_{1}} * \underbrace{\mathrm{i} \int \int f(t) \mathrm{d} t \mathrm{d} \eta_{-}}_{z_{2}}))  \mathrm{d} T = 1/2\pi * \int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty} ( \int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty}  f(t) * (cos(t/T)+\mathrm{i} sin(t/T)) \mathrm{d} t ) \mathrm{d} T
\end{equation}
Note: If the angle $\phi$ between two complex numbers $z_{1},z_{2}$ is $\pm\frac{pi}{2}$, their complex multiple $z_{1}*z_{2}$ is equal the real $\lvert z_{1}\rvert*\lvert z_{2}\rvert$. If $x_{1}=y_{2}$, this simplifies to $\lvert x_{1} \rvert ^2$, which is what we have noted above (Parseval Theorem) for the real function $f(t)$ .\\\\
This equation holds for every signal with frequency components separated in the time domain and symmetric in $mod(n/2)=0$ equal length parts. If this is not the case, we have either:\\
1. Longer wavelength pulses overlapping the frequency component, which results in a amplitude modulation of the combined signal.\\
2. Shorter wavelength pulses intersecting the segments of the frequency component, which results in frequency modulation of the combined signal.\\
3. Non-symmetric waveforms and/or different length half-pulses, which can not be removed with this procedure. See Source Separation for further discussion of such signals.\\\\
(A longer wavelength, undetected harmonic can be excluded in this scenario since source separated harmonics are symmetric pulses of integer multiples of the wavelength and we imply that the shortest $symmetric$ pulse is found beforehand in the removal procedure below, i.e. the higher harmonics are $not symmetric$ because of criteria 1)\\\\
Conclusion: This method provides an indication for the spectral separation of the signal. For blind removal of individual pulses, the $waveform$ of the pulse needs to be known. Longer wavelength pulses have the highest likelyhood to contain pulses which violate the above criteria, so their $amplitude$ can not be determined. We have to start removal with the shortest isolated pulses which can be found in the sample.
