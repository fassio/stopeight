Initially the aim of this paper was to make separated sources in a mixed signal comparable using either numeric or geometric overlay comparison (currently implemented), regardless of time and amplitude stretch, but preserving frequency modulation and amplitude ratios.\\
In the course of specifying the Stopeight Analyzer transversality, which serves as a foundation for the subsequent procedures, some more aspects have taken shape. These aspects are encapsulated in the definition of two complex numbers, isolation and visibility. Visibility may lead to a method of approximating polynomials of arbitrary degree. Isolation is an indication of the fractal dimension and cutoff of the approximation.

\chapter{Vector Graph Inverses}
\section{Graph Inverse}
Start of the signal $s(x);x=0$, scaling factor (for example numeric average $\frac{\int \limits _{0}^{n}\vert s(x)\vert \mathrm{d}x}{n}$) and $\iota_{X}(t)$ are needed.
\begin{equation}
vectorgraph^{-1}: \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}
\end{equation}
The signal reconstruction is lossless.
\section{Approximation Inverse}
Start of the signal $s(x);x=0$, scaling factor and $\xi(t)$ are needed. Consider the loss of information in Arcs $A$ caused by Straights and Spikes.
\begin{equation}
vectorgraph^{-1}: \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}
\end{equation}
It is possible to reconstruct a signal from the approximation, effectively making it a suitable format for compression. It can also make Vector Graphs, which have not been obtained from a signal, audible or suitable for 1-dimensional analysis.\\
Note: The compression is dynamic. In some cases, the data may actually increase.

\chapter{Downsampling Wavelet}
Because the Vector Graph is invertible, any basis that can reconstruct the Vector Graph $\iota_{X}$ from derived parametrisations is also a basis of the original signal $s(x)$.\\
The method is a multiresolution approach. It is not a proper wavelet. Instead, a frequency-only basis is applied inside the Grapher \cite{Stopeight}[1.1] \emph{before} the \emph{transversality} $Y$ is calculated. Then, a local cosine basis is applied on the parametrisations. \cite{Mallat}[1.3.4]\\\\
The angles in the Vector Graph are a Wavelet if $2^j$ is the block size, n is the block index, t is as previously defined.\\\\
The signal $s(t)$ is a parametrisation of $s(x)$. The taxicab norm $\norm{\cdot}_{1}$ is preserved $c,d \in X$.\\\\
Summing the vectors in the Vector Graph up to the period $T \in dom(s)$ removes jitter and is subject to shift $i \in dom(s)$.
\begin{align}
Z = \{c,d \in X \vert T=\frac{\norm{d}_1-\norm{c}_1}{2^j};c=i+kT;k,j \in \mathbb{Z}\}
\end{align}
Note: Downsampling the signal $s(x)$ before calculating the \emph{Vector Graph}, would obliterate points in $\iota_{X}$. They would not be recoverable, because as a consequence of downsampling, the Vector Graph folds differently, rendering the points in the original full resolution invalid.\\\\
In the following chapters the domain of the functions $f \circ g \circ h$ on which sets $Y,A,O$ depend on is overridden $dom(\iota_{Y},\xi,\iota_{O})=Z$.\\\\
If $j=\inf$, then $T=0$. The resulting limits for isolation and visibility are one and zero respectively.

\chapter{Isolation}
Isolation is the product of the ratios of the arc-lengths of the approximation and the input.
\begin{equation}
isolation(a,b)=\lim _{k\rightarrow\inf} \prod _{i=0}^{(b-a)/k} \int \limits _{i*\frac{b-a}{k}}^{(i+1)*\frac{b-a}{k}} \frac{\xi'(t)}{\iota'_{X}(t)} \mathrm{d}t
\end{equation}
Note: The antiderivative exists. It is smooth (~\cite[Riemann Integrable]{Widon}).\\\\
The discrete notation of isolation is.
\begin{equation}
isolation(a,b)= \prod _{i=a}^{b-1} (\frac{\norm{\xi(i+1)-\xi(i)}_{2}}{\norm{\iota_{X}(i+1)-\iota_{X}(i)}_{2}}/(b-a))
\end{equation}

\chapter{Visibility}
Visibility is computed by creating an auxiliary set of chart-wise points
\begin{equation}
h: U_{n} \mapsto [a,b] \mapsto O_{n}
\end{equation}
Note: Because of Corner insertion (\cite{Stopeight}[3.20]), $card(U_{n}) \geq 3$.\\\\
They are Centres of Cliffs by the arithmetic mean,
\begin{align}
O_{n}=\{(x',y') \in \mathbb{R}^2 \vert \min \norm{(x,y)-(x',y')}_{2};(x,y) \in U_{n} \}\\
\norm{\cdot}_{2}=\sqrt{(x-x')^2 + (y-y')^2}
\end{align}
$[-\pi,\pi]$ is replaced with $[a,b]$. This is the Continuous Fourier \emph{Transform}.
\begin{align}
visibility(a,b)= \int \limits _{-\inf}^{+inf}\int \limits _{a}^{b}\lvert \vert \xi(t)-\iota_{O}(t)\vert * \mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i}\omega t} \rvert^2 \mathrm{d}t \mathrm{d}\omega
\end{align}\\\\
Eventually a Discrete, Fast version of visibility can be used.\\
The polar unit circle line corresponding to the absolute value of an angle is.
\begin{align}
z(k) = \cos(k*(m/2^j) + \mathrm{i}\sqrt{1-(\cos(k*(m/2^j)))^2}
\end{align}
Visibility is now based on the Haar spots in the approximation.
\begin{align}
visibility(a,b,j)= \sum _{k=0}^{(b-a)/(m/2^j)}\lvert \vert \xi(k*(m/2^j))-\iota_{O}(k*(m/2^j))\vert * z(k) \rvert^2
\end{align}
Note: Orthogonal Wavelet Base? Is this a (Fast) Wavelet Transform?

\chapter{Polynomials and Splines}
Finding their Handrolls (chart on Spiral, tangential space).
\begin{align}
C_{O}=\sup_{t \in U} \lvert \frac{\mathrm{d}^2}{\mathrm{d}t^2}visibility(t) \rvert \approx 0
\end{align}
Finding Eliptic Joints.\\
\begin{align}
T_{O}=\inf_{t \in V} \lvert \frac{\mathrm{d}^2}{\mathrm{d}t^2}visibility(t) \rvert \approx 0
\end{align}

\chapter{After Separation}
Asymetric, non-repetitive non-smooth (pulses), which can be compared by matchline overlay comparison.\\\\
Sisyphus: A Foray into Fractals\\
Let's take the example of Sisyphus rolling a rock up a parabolic hill. We measure the altitude of the rock as a function of time. Sisyphus will roll the rock up the hill much slower than it will roll down the hill. Therefore variance of the Vector Graph in one direction is much lower than going in the other direction, but the periodicity of the falling depends on the rising.\\
If we compare this to the formation of mountain ridges and their erosion, we can still say they depend on each other, but the periodicity is much more disconnected. The formation of mountain ridges depends on the flow of magma and ultimately on the thermomagnetic energy within the planet. Erosion, however depends on a much shorter period, which depends on the availability of atmosphere and ocean and the electromagnetic energy directed at them by the sun.\\
The Vector Graph is non-symmetric in regard of time. Because phase varies there is no frequency; We speak of periodicity. An acoustic impulse propagates symmetrically as it oscillates between two fixed values. We can therefore assume that it has a fixed variance in both directions. This criteria is not true for our geological example. We may have to use different means to find correlations. This is where the Stopeight Comparator comes in handy.\\
