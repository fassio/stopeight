The goal of separation is to find impulses or notes as they may be referred to in a musical context. It is important to note that the individual pulses have a causal relationship that connects them. Most oscillations are subject to amplitude and/or frequency-modulation, but they are usually repetitive, so they can be removed by statistical means. Truly random/stochastic signals on the other hand can not be filtered.

\subsection{Pulse}
A symmetric pulse has two half pulses with the same wavelength/amplitude correlation.

\subsection{Impulses}
Impulses are consecutive half-pulses of variable wavelengths which originate from the same source and are separated from other overlaping impulses.

\chapter{Spectral Separation}
The main drawback of Fourier Transformation is that frames (integration bounds) and frequency window (measure) have to be adjusted. There are methods for finding exact frames in order to remove orthogonal subspaces. In signal analysis, there is the notion of source separated vs. spectral separated pulses. Fourier Transformation does fulfil the task of spectral separation, but arbitrary precision in the time and frequency domain can not be found.

\chapter{Source Separation}
Stopeight Analyzer may provide a means of either finding exact frames (of length pulse or impulse?) in the original signal $s(x)$ (See Grapher), or in the signal as in parametric curve differences of the type $\lvert \xi(t)-\iota_{T}(t) \rvert$. It also defines the negative time in the Fourier Transform of the signal $s(x);x<0$  to be the analytic direction $dir=-1$.\\\\
Also Vector Graph manipulations such as finding/counting intersections and setting oriented section type occurence limitations (ex. Spiral $\Rightarrow$ scale) could yield interesting results.

\section{Transversality}

\subsection{Signs}
The difference of the signs over an interval.
\begin{align}
dsi(a,b) = card(\mu_{+}\subseteq [a,b])-card(\mu_{-} \subseteq [a,b])\\
ori(a,b) = \frac{dsi(a,b)}{\lvert dsi(a,b) \rvert}
\end{align}
A sequence of sections between $[a,b]$ is alternating $\mu_{-}\cup \mu_{zero}\cup\mu_{+}=\mu$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $dsi(a,b)= 0; \exists(\mu_{n}\subseteq \mu_{+}) \land \exists(\mu_{n+1}\subseteq \mu_{zero}) \land \exists(\mu_{n+2}\subseteq \mu_{-}) \Leftrightarrow alt(a,b)=n$
\item $dsi(a,b)= 0; \exists(\mu_{n}\subseteq \mu_{-}) \land \exists(\mu_{n+1}\subseteq \mu_{zero}) \land \exists(\mu_{n+2}\subseteq \mu_{+}) \Leftrightarrow alt(a,b)=-n$
\item $dsi(a,b)= 1; \exists(\mu_{n}\subseteq \mu_{+}) \land \exists(\mu_{n+1}\subseteq \mu_{zero}) \land \nexists(\mu_{n+2}\subseteq \mu_{-}) \Leftrightarrow alt(a,b)=\frac{1}{n}$
\item $dsi(a,b)= -1; \exists(\mu_{n}\subseteq \mu_{-}) \land \exists(\mu_{n+1}\subseteq \mu_{zero}) \land \nexists(\mu_{n+2}\subseteq \mu_{+}) \Leftrightarrow alt(a,b)=-\frac{1}{n}$
\item $dsi(a,b)> \pm 1\Leftrightarrow alt(a,b)=0$;
\end{enumerate}
When the difference of the signs $dsi(a,b)$ is larger than one, orientation $ori$ serves as a weak expression of the imbalance.

\subsection{Recursion}
($alt(a,b)$ products across interval spaces?)\\\\
Typically, we do $signs$ over scale-spaces by setting the domain to $dom(\iota,\xi)=K_{p}$.
Which is reflected in the $\mu(\gamma_{dom})$ of sum of a function over a scale space.\\
\begin{equation}
signs(\mu_{+},function )= \sum \limits _{\inf \limits _{\mu_{+}} (b-a)}^{\sup \limits _{\mu_{+}} (b-a)} function (a,b)
\end{equation}
$times$ is the product of a function over a interval space $dom(\iota,\xi)=T_{n}$.
\begin{equation}
times(\mu_{+},function) = \prod_{\inf \limits _{\mu_{+}} (b-a)}^{\sup \limits _{\mu_{+}} (b-a)} function(a,b)
\end{equation}

\subsection{Area of Jitter}
The integral of the parametrisation on a non-Straight segment is larger than the integral of the parametrisation of a straight segment. (Additional benefits?)
\begin{align}
area_{jitter}(a,b)=\frac{\int \limits _{0}^{(b-a)/2} \lvert \iota_{X}(b-t)-\iota_{X}(a+t)\rvert \mathrm{d}t}{\int \limits _{0}^{(b-a)/2} diameter_{horiz,T}(a+t,b-t)\mathrm{d}t}\\
\end{align}

\subsection{Imaginary Visibility}
Visibility is an increase of the polynomial Coefficients(?) of a curve segment.
(No: When visibility is increased in a Spiral, it creates more subsegments/scale spaces). Points in $Y$ become uncertain at around $2\pi/3$. It is a Cantor-like diminishing isolation.
\begin{align}
visibility(a,b)= alt(a,b) * signs(\mu,solidangle_{Rel}(a,b))\\
visibility(a,b)= alt(a,b) * signs(\mu,curvature(a,b)-Q(a,b))(?)
\end{align}
(Lebesgue on curvature? $Max_{Curve}$ based or sign based?)
\subsection*{Cases}
When curvature is decreased in a Spiral, it becomes a ZigZag.
\subsection*{Scale Space}
$area$ grows, but $diameter$ constant.

\subsection{Real Isolation}
(No: A lack of isolation is directly linked to the creation of more interval spaces.)
\begin{align}
isolation(a,b) = ori(a,b)*times(\mu,\frac{1}{area_{jitter}(a,b)})\\
isolation(a,b) = ori(a,b)*times(\mu,straightness(a,b))(?)
\end{align}
(Frame bundle orthonormal?)
\subsection*{Interval Space}
$jitter$ grows, but $diameter$ constant.

\subsection{Jaggedness}
Is aliasing of discretisation/rasterisation, but not to be confused with signal aliasing. Can be defined on Focals and Turns.
\begin{align}
jaggedness(a,b)=\int \limits _{a}^{b} \lvert \iota_{X}(t)-\xi_{F}(t)\rvert \mathrm{d}t
\end{align}

\section{Indicator}
Consider: A polar to cartesian transform is a convolution with a sum of two fundamental numeric Taylor Series Expansions. Sine and Cosine functions are intrinsically linked to the quadratic entity $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} =1$ and dividing the circle by four (90 deg.). Hyperbolic Sine is linked to $1/x$.\\\\
In order for Stopeight overlay comparison to work, source separation has to be performed. A complex function measuring separation can be defined as.
\begin{equation}
separation(a,b) = isolation(a,b) + \mathrm{i} visibility(a,b)
\end{equation}
Important: This can be calculated while resampling. (See Grapher)\\\\
Eventually, bounds of periodicity could be found. The directed waves of straightness and curvature going forward/backward synchronously are periodic.
\begin{align}
periodicity(a,b) =  (\int \limits _{a}^{b} \xi(t)-\iota_{X}(t) \mathrm{dt}) *(visibility(a,b) +\mathrm{i} isolation(a,b))
\end{align}
Or directly on the signal?
\begin{align}
periodicity(a,b) =  (\int \limits _{a}^{b} s(t) \mathrm{dt}) *(visibility(a,b) +\mathrm{i} isolation(a,b))
\end{align}
Note: $visibility$ and $isolation$ already include the trigonometric functions of the polar to cartesian transform.\\
Explanation:\\
The imaginary part is the other side of the wave vs\\
The imaginary part is the phase shift (fft)\\\\
(multiplication? addition?)
\begin{align}
(a,b) \mapsto z
\end{align}

\subsection*{Complex Norm}
A complex norm $\norm{\cdot}$ is defined on the transversality.
\begin{align}
\norm{\cdot} : \mathbb{C} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\\
\norm{z} = \sqrt{Re(z)^2+Im(z)^2}
\end{align}

\subsection*{After Separation}
Asymetric, non-repetitive pulses, which can be compared by matchline overlay comparison (See Sisyphos)
