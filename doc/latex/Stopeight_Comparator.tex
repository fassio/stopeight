Initially the aim of this paper was to make separated sources in a mixed signal comparable using either numeric or geometric overlay comparison (currently implemented), regardless of time and amplitude stretch, but preserving frequency modulation and amplitude ratios.\\
In the course of specifying the Stopeight Analyzer transversality, which serves as a foundation for the subsequent procedures, some more aspects have taken shape. These aspects are encapsulated in the definition of two complex numbers, isolation and visibility. Visibility may lead to a method of approximating polynomials of arbitrary degree. Isolation is an indication of the fractal dimension and cutoff of the approximation.

\chapter{Isolation}
Isolation was meant to be the ratio of the arc-lengths of the approximation and the input $\xi'(t)/\iota'_{X}(t)$.\\\\
The square root of the product $\sqrt{\xi'(t)*\iota'_{X}(t)}$ happens to be the geometric mean.
\begin{equation}
isolation(a,b)=\int \limits _{a}^{b} \sqrt{\xi'(t)*\iota'_{X}(t)} \mathrm{d}t
\end{equation}
Note: Taking the mean instead of the ratio has a few implications. Lets assume we have computed the Stopeight Analyzer transversality by applying the affine transformations in a positive direction $dir_{Y}=1$. We now measure this against the actual input in the same direction $dir_{X}=1$. The resulting number is entirely real.\\\\
The antiderivative exists. It is smooth (~\cite[Riemann Integrable]{Widon}). Therefore a convolution can be applied \emph{after} integration.\\
It can have values between $[0,\inf]$, which is useful for this convolution:\\
\begin{equation}
woodpecker(a,b)=isolation(a,b)
\end{equation}
Note: If we had chosen a product of geometric means instead of the convolution would make that isolation grows if the means are $(0,1]$, or even worse canceled out for zeros. A sum would not amplify the effect of large geometric means in short intervals.

\chapter{Visibility}
Visibility is computed by creating an auxiliary set of chart-wise points
\begin{equation}
h: U_{m} \mapsto [a,b] \mapsto O_{m}
\end{equation}
Note: Because of Corner insertion (\cite{Stopeight}[3.20]), $card(U_{m}) \geq 3$.\\\\
They are Centres of Cliffs by the arithmetic mean,\\
\begin{align}
O_{m}=\{(x',y') \in \mathbb{R}^2 \vert \min \norm{(x,y)-(x',y')}_{2};(x,y) \in U_{m} \}\\
\norm{\cdot}_{2}=\sqrt{(x-x')^2 + (y-y')^2}
\end{align}
\begin{align}
visibility(a,b)= \int \limits _{a}^{b}\vert \iota_{X}(t)-\iota_{O}(t)\vert * (\cos(angle(t)) + \mathrm{i}\sin(angle(t))) \mathrm{d}t\\
angle(t)=\arctan\frac{x(\gamma(t)-O_{m})}{y(\gamma(t)-O_{m})},t \in U_{m}
\end{align}
Note: Angle not smooth and flips sign!! Integration \emph{after} convolution. Division of two complex numbers is partial/total derivative?

\chapter{Polynomials and Splines}
Finding their Handrolls (chart on Spiral, tangential space).
\begin{align}
C_{O}=\sup_{t \in U} \lvert \frac{\mathrm{d}^2}{\mathrm{d}t^2}visibility(t) \rvert \approx 0
\end{align}
Finding Eliptic Joints.\\
\begin{align}
T_{O}=\inf_{t \in V} \lvert \frac{\mathrm{d}^2}{\mathrm{d}t^2}visibility(t) \rvert \approx 0
\end{align}

\chapter{After Separation}
Asymetric, non-repetitive non-smooth (pulses), which can be compared by matchline overlay comparison.\\\\
Sisyphus: A Foray into Fractals\\
Let's take the example of Sisyphus rolling a rock up a parabolic hill. We measure the altitude of the rock as a function of time. Sisyphus will roll the rock up the hill much slower than it will roll down the hill. Therefore variance of the Vector Graph in one direction is much lower than going in the other direction, but the periodicity of the falling depends on the rising.\\
If we compare this to the formation of mountain ridges and their erosion, we can still say they depend on each other, but the periodicity is much more disconnected. The formation of mountain ridges depends on the flow of magma and ultimately on the thermomagnetic energy within the planet. Erosion, however depends on a much shorter period, which depends on the availability of atmosphere and ocean and the electromagnetic energy directed at them by the sun.\\
The Vector Graph is non-symmetric in regard of time. Because phase varies there is no frequency; We speak of periodicity. An acoustic impulse propagates symmetrically as it oscillates between two fixed values. We can therefore assume that it has a fixed variance in both directions. This criteria is not true for our geological example. We may have to use different means to find correlations. This is where the Stopeight Comparator comes in handy.\\
