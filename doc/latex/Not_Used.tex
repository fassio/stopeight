\chapter{Introduction}
time-variant (not invariant)\\
More complex scenarios may be considered, where Spirals are avoided, the number of 8's are limited or the signal is resampled.\\
Within $f$ we are assigning a sequence of three points to compact Hausdorf invervals ~\cite[6.1.3.]{Mortad}:
\begin{equation}
\{x_{n}\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \mapsto \{S,C,E\}
\end{equation}\\\\

The purpose of the Analyzer is to find intervals in a Vector Graph and produce an approximation. The input Vector Graph may be obtained from the Grapher, or it may be present in another mathematical context. Certain properties, such as the maximum derivative or the quantity or quality of measure spaces involved, are inherited from this context.\\\\

\subsection{Legal Segment}
(~\cite[Riemann Integrable?]{Widon})

\subsection{Straight}
A Straight is a segment $[a,b]$ where $straightness(a,b)$ is smaller or equal to the ratio of the arc length of a hyperbola $1/x$ to the arc length of its direct connecting line $-\frac{x}{\mathrm{e}}+\frac{1+\mathrm{e}}{\mathrm{e}}$ from $1$ to $\mathrm{e}$. It is a part of a Spike, or transfering the Straight half of an Edge to an adjacent ZigZag, or being used as part of Edge detection. A Corner is $inserted$ .
\begin{align}
Max_{Straight}=\int \limits _{1}^{\mathrm{e}}\frac{\lvert\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\frac{1}{x}\rvert}{\lvert\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}(-\frac{x}{\mathrm{e}}+\frac{1+\mathrm{e}}{\mathrm{e}})\rvert}\mathrm{d}t\\
C_{3} \ni \frac{b-a}{2}
\end{align}

Non-recursive sections are not proper section types, but merely an expression of intermediate calculation and are therefore of medium computational priority (See discussion of oriented submanifolds in Compact Covers). They do induce a shift inside the Compact Cover if they're not centered.\\\\
The $Max$ thresholds are reductions of measure spaces. The $derivatives$ are affected by $Max_{Straight}$. The Grapher $scale$ interacts with $Max_{Curvre}.$\\\\

Measure Space: Curvature is no more than $(x')^2 + (y')^2 =1$  under any linear transformation of any segment and implies a creation of measure-spaces depending on scale.

\subsection*{Half Cliff}
Even though Half Cliffs are not being used, it is worth mentioning, that they produce Corners just to make the notation complete.
\begin{align}
Max_{Quarter}=\frac{((\pi-2) r^2) /4}{r}\\
C_{3} \ni b'
\end{align}\\\\

Measure Space: Straightness is no more than what is required for a hyperbola not to be considered straight under any linear transformation of any segment and implies a creation of measure spaces depending on intervals of changing signs.\\\\

\subsection*{Absolute Differences}
Once these entities have been found, we can start to use absolute differences by means of setting the domain of $\xi$ and $\iota$ to $Swing \cup C_{3} \cup C_{4}$ unless noted otherwise.
\begin{align}
jitter(a.b)=\int \limits _{a}^{b}\lvert \iota_{X}(t) - \xi(t) \rvert \mathrm{d}t\\
area_{vert}(a,b)=\int \limits _{a}^{b} \lvert \xi(t)-\iota(t) \rvert \mathrm{d}t
\end{align}
\begin{align}
straightness_{Abs}(a.b)=\frac{jitter(a,b)}{diameter_{horiz}(a,b)}
\end{align}
\begin{align}
curvature_{Abs}(a,b) = \frac{area_{vert}(a,b)}{diameter_{horiz}(a,b)}
\end{align}

\section{Recursive Sections}
Derivatives are opening up interval measure spaces. The scale-space sets the maximal order of the polynomials considered. In the method discussed in this paper, it is quartic with restrictions, i.e. the representation is quadratic.  (The functions $q$ and the points $S,C,E$ pose a constraint on the quartic analytic form ~\cite[Spline\_CharacteristicPolynomials.nb]{Stopeight} and its inverse.)\\\\
The following recursive subsections reveal hidden derivatives.

\subsection{Spike}
(Also?)
\begin{align}
angle(a,b',c)\geq\\
straightness(a,b)\approx 1\\
curvature(a,b)>0
\end{align}

\subsection{Relative Areas}
The $solidangle(a,c)$ is defined by the Spike Margin $[a,b',b'',c]$.
\begin{align}
solidangle_{Rel}(a,c) = \frac{area(b',b'')}{(diameter_{horiz}(a,c)/2)^2}
\end{align}

\subsection{Spiral}
Note: $b'$ is the Corner $C_{4}$ of the Eliptic Approximation if the Focal Points overlap (full circle). See Spline Axioms / Eliptic Approximation.

\subsection{ZigZag}
Note: $b'$ is the Corner $C$ of the Eliptic Approximation where the Focal Point is perpendicular to the tangent in $C$, but infinitely far away. See Spline Axioms / Eliptic Approximation.

\subsection{Area of Jitter}
The integral of the parametrisation on a non-Straight segment is larger than the integral of the parametrisation of a straight segment. (Additional benefits?)
\begin{align}
area_{jitter}(a,b)=\frac{\int \limits _{0}^{(b-a)/2} \lvert \iota_{X}(b-t)-\iota_{X}(a+t)\rvert \mathrm{d}t}{\int \limits _{0}^{(b-a)/2} diameter_{horiz,T}(a+t,b-t)\mathrm{d}t}
\end{align}
