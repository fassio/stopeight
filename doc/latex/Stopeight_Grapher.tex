\section{Vector Graph}
Consider a function that produces a sequence of independent vectors with coordinates $x,y \in \mathbb{R}$.
\begin{equation}
Anything \rightarrow \{(x,y)_{m}\}_{m \in \mathbb{Z}}
\end{equation}
Note: It is a metric space with the Euclidean norm $(\mathbb{R}^2,\norm{\cdot}_2)$.\\\\
The Vector Graph of the sequence of vectors is its appended form. The vectors are translated by the preceding ones.\\
\begin{equation}
vectorgraph_{\log_{2}(m)}: (x,y)_{n}=\sum_{i=0}^{n} (x,y)_{i}
\end{equation}
Note: It is a metric space with a taxicab norm $(X,\norm{\cdot}_1)$.
\section{Wavelets}
The appended form can, but does not have to be, subdivided into $2^j$ partitions of size $m/2^j$. The vectors in the partition are sumed and the resulting vector is stretched by the effective length of the taxicab norm of the vectors in the partition.
\begin{equation}
vectorgraph_{j}:(x,y)_{n}=\sum_{i=0}^{n} (\norm{(x,y)_{(i+1)*m/2^j}}_{1} - \norm{(x,y)_{i*m/2^j}}_{1} * \frac{\sum_{k=i*m/2^j}^{(i+1)*m/2^j} (x,y)_{k}}{\vert \sum_{k=i*m/2^j}^{(i+1)*m/2^j} (x,y)_{k} \vert})
\end{equation}
This ensures that the traversal distances are preserved!
\begin{equation}
(vectorgraph_{j},\norm{\cdot}_{1})=(vectorgraph_{j+1},\norm{\cdot}_{1})
\end{equation}
\section{Time Variant}
Even a time-variant version of the Vector Graph can be thought of. It is composed of a sequence of $p$ Vector Graph pieces on the same taxicab norm $(\{X_{p}\}_{p\in \mathbb{Z}},\norm{\cdot}_1)$.
\subsection{Equalising Length}
It may be desirable to work with vectors of the same length. This may be required for inverting the Vector Graph $vectorgraph^{-1}$ or comparing two different Vector Graphs.\\\\
To avoid interpolation, integer multiples of the vector lengths over all sequences would have to be used.\\\\
Clearly, choosing a $j$ that results in a Euclidean distance smaller than the highest Euclidean distance in the entire sequence $\{X_{p}\}$ is not recommended for comparison because of missing data.
\begin{equation}
(m/2^j)*\inf \limits _{X} \sqrt{(x^2+y^2)} \geq \sup \limits _{\{X_{p}\}} \sqrt{(x^2+y^2)}
\end{equation}

\chapter{Usage Scenarios}
\section{Domain (Time) Scalability}
This Vector Graph has to be constructed by appending a vector $(0,y)_{n+1}$ to an existing vector $(x,y)_{n}$ at an angle relative to the existing vector. Here, the length is the same sampling rate $2^j$ and the angle is chosen to be based on the average of the signal change and the actual change. The values are fitted to be in the range $[-\pi,\pi]$ to allow for the occurence of the full feature set supported by the Analyser.
\begin{align}
angle_{n+1}=angle_{n}+2*\arcsin(\vert(x,y)_{n+1}\vert/\frac{\int \limits _{a}^{b} s'(t) \mathrm{d}t}{b-a})
\end{align}
\subsection{Finding Bounds}
In a one dimensional mixed signal $s(t)$, there are quiet, low frequencies. They are difficult to spot because of the presence of high frequency noise. Creating a Vector Graph provides a high precision solution to the adequate time-localisation of these pulses, and even half pulses where the wavelength is not known.
\subsection{Comparison}
After the feature points have been extracted in the Analyser, a reference Vector Graph can be compared to a subsection of a query Vector Graph. This is being done by geometrically overlaying and matching them within an offset threshold. The overlay is being done using affine transformations. This is not documented but currently implemented in the Stopeight Comparator project.\\\\
For the comparison to work, both Vector Graphs have to be scaled by the same angle function.
