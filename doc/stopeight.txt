Note: You need to install stopeight-clibs before installing stopeight or the python extensions are not compiled.

Python 2: PyQt5 has been removed for Python 2. You have to install it manually from `Riverbank <https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download5>`_ or your distro. Also you need a recent gcc::

    $ sudo apt-get install python-pyqt5 gcc-6
    $ pip install numpy future funcsigs matplotlib pybind11>=2.2
    $ pip install --user --no-deps stopeight

Python 3::

    $ pip install --user stopeight

Eventually you will need the server module, test scripts and test data::

    $ git clone https://github.com/specpose/stopeight.git
