Analyzer Algorithm
==================

The Analyzer subdivides into half-circles, represented by only one tangent on-curve control point per half-circle.
This is the equivalent of four hyperbolic / two parabolic subsegments. It is the ideal format for :doc:`comparator`.

See `Composite Bezier Splines <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_B%C3%A9zier_curve>`_

Corners are surrounded/terminated by turns (TCT). This is the final representation format after analysis, where turn can refer to a starting/ending point, a crest/spike or a cliff in the Vector Graph.

Frontside/backside crests have to be detected going both forward and backward.

Cliffs have to be centered from both sides if there is an even number of occurences.
