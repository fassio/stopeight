Pen stroke test data can be found in the repository stopeight-clibs. As you can see you have now loaded the raw data of a pen-stroke. Any arc-wise connected series of 2D points can be loaded but you have to provide your own GUI at the time being. The sample data has been hand-drawn on a Wacom Cintiq 21UX and plain mouse using the editor binary.

It has to be extracted from here::

    $ cd /path/to/where/stopeight-clibs/tests
    $ tar xvfz v0-1-0.tar.gz
