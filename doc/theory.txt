Theory
======

Most of the mathematics are only available in LaTeX form at the moment. PDF files have to be built from source :doc:`build_latex`.

Preparing the data involves the following two or three steps:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   vector-graph

   analyzer

* :doc:`vector-graph`
    Working.

    Turning a Function Graph into a Vector Graph.

* :doc:`analyzer`
    Legacy pen-stroke version: Partially working.

    Analyzer time-series and resolution independent version: Not yet implemented.

    Extracting feature points from a Vector Graph for matchline overlay comparison.

The Comparator can do searches in the prepared data:

* Comparator
    Working.

    (Documentation missing: See developer instructions :doc:`dev_comparator`)
