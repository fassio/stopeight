Analyzing pen-strokes from a 2D input device.
=============================================

To use the stopeight-clibs-legacy for the (stroke) analyzer, get::

    $ git clone https://github.com/fassio/stopeight-clibs.git

Pen stroke test data has to be extracted::

    $ cd /path/to/where/stopeight-clibs/tests
    $ tar xvfz v0-1-0.tar.gz

Compile it::

    $ cd /path/to/where/stopeight-clibs/legacy
    $ make

And add it to the library path::
    
    $ sudo ldconfig /path/to/where/stopeight-clibs/legacy/
    $ cd /path/to/where/stopeight-clibs/legacy-wrappers

Run the interpreter::
    
    $ python setup.py build
    $ python
    >>> import sys
    >>> sys.path.append('/path/to/where/stopeight-clibs/legacy-wrappers/build/lib.linux-x86_64-2.7')
    >>> import stopeight_clibs_legacy
    >>> line = stopeight_clibs_legacy.parse_file('/path/to/where/FILENAME.sp')
    >>> print line

As you can see you have now loaded the raw data of a pen-stroke. The test files have been generated with a Wacom Cintiq 21UX using the editor binary.
