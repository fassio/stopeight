stopeight-clibs
---------------

As of 05/2016 only python version 2.7, qt4, qt5 and Ubuntu 14.04 have been tested.

If you installed qt-creator version 4 you already have them::

    $ sudo apt-get install qt4-qmake libqt4-dev

If you installed qt-creator version 5 you already have them::

    $ sudo apt-get install qt5-qmake qtbase5-dev qt5-default

In Ubuntu 14.04 these libraries are pre-installed::

    $ sudo apt-get install libqt4-core libqt4-gui

And the GCC compiler and tools::

    $ sudo apt-get install g++ make

stopeight-clibs-legacy. Get::

    $ git clone https://github.com/specpose/stopeight-clibs.git

Run qmake to generate the Makefile, then compile, install and add to library path::

    $ cd /path/to/where/stopeight-clibs/legacy
    $ qmake-qt4 -o ./Makefile legacy.pro
    $ make

You may need to install them to your library path::

    $ sudo make install
    $ sudo ldconfig

Do the same for analyzer. It needs C++11::

    $ cd /path/to/where/stopeight-clibs/analyzer
    $ qmake -o ./Makefile analyzer.pro
    $ make
    $ sudo make install
    $ sudo ldconfig

Note: You may need to manually reinstall after a rebuild::

    $ cp libstopeight-clibs-* /path/to/where/your/syslibs
    $ sudo ldconfig

Or: Add them to your path

You will need python development headers::

    $ sudo apt-get install python2.7-dev

Build and install the python API for pen-strokes::
    
    $ cd /path/to/where/stopeight-clibs/legacy-wrappers
    $ python setup.py build

You may need to install the wrappers to the python path::

    $ sudo python setup.py install
