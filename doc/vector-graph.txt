Function Graph
--------------

Any time-based data set with an accurate sampling rate can be used to build a function f(x).

Vector Graph
------------

This function graph can be converted into a sequence of vectors in a two-dimensional plane.

The construction of the graph can be seen here:

Definition of the ratio between opposite and adjacent of the right triangle:

Delta f(x) at point A / the average of all Delta f(x) of the Delta x's between x0 and x1.

Condition: All Delta x are invariant.

By varying the step-size you can achieve:

And by making it even smaller you can get:

This last step reduces the impulse scaling to half the frequency found in the previous example. So for matchline overlay comparison the previous vector graph is preferred.
